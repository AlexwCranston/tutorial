## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Input the Data}
setwd("C:/Users/alexw/OneDrive/Desktop/Introduction to R/Data")
GardenOzone <- read.csv("GardenOzone.csv")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Plotting the Data, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(GardenOzone, aes(x= Ozone, fill=Garden.location))+ 
  geom_histogram(bins=10)+ 
  facet_wrap(~Garden.location, ncol=1) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("cyan4","firebrick1"))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
